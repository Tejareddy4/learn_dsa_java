        /*
        explanation from chat gpt:
        The 2L in 2L * n * (n - 1) ensures that the multiplication is performed using long arithmetic in Java.

Explanation:
In Java, integer literals like 2 are of type int by default.
If n is large (e.g., 69675), then 2 * n * (n - 1) could exceed the range of int (which is -2^31 to 2^31 - 1 or -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647).
Using 2L explicitly makes the multiplication use long (64-bit integer) instead of int (32-bit integer).
This prevents integer overflow and ensures correctness when n is large.
